# 🔮 Quantum-Inspired Gradient Descent (QGD)

Optimization lies at the core of machine learning, yet traditional methods like **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** and **Momentum** often face trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency in complex scenarios.

This project presents **Quantum-Inspired Gradient Descent (QGD)**—a novel optimization approach that incorporates **quantum concepts** such as **superposition** and **entanglement** into gradient descent. QGD aims to enhance convergence speed and accuracy, particularly in tasks like **velocity prediction**.

Through rigorous experiments, QGD outperforms classical optimizers by achieving a **lower MAE (4.6539)** and **faster convergence (0.04s)**, establishing its role as a scalable and computationally efficient optimization technique.

### 📌 Explanation of Metrics

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**
  Measures the average magnitude of errors. Lower values indicate better accuracy.

* **R² (Coefficient of Determination):**
  Represents how well the model captures the variance. Values close to **1** are ideal; negative values indicate poor model fit.

* **Explained Variance:**
  Quantifies the amount of data variance the model explains. Negative values suggest performance worse than a mean-based prediction.
